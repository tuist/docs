# Create a new project

The most straightforward way to start a new project with Tuist is to use the `tuist init` command. This command generates a new project with a default structure and configuration. The generated project includes a `Project.swift` file that defines the project's structure and settings. The `Project.swift` file is a Swift script that uses the Tuist API to define the project's structure and settings.
